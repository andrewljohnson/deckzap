# DeckZap

This is the code for game engine and website for DeckZap, a pre-alpha uncollectible card game platform: http://deckzap.com

# Run the app locally for development

I have run the app on a Mac, and the server is Ubuntu Linux.

## Running locally

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add a `SECRET_KEY`. Then run:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Separately, start the Parcel bundler:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

## Running django-admin commands

`docker-compose run web python manage.py <command>`

## Connecting to the database

`docker-compose run db psql "postgresql://$POSTGRES_USER:$POSTGRES_PASSWORD@db/$POSTGRES_DB"`

## CI

Tests run automatically with GitHub Actions. The Docker images are also built here, and stored in GitHub Packages.
A personal access token is required to push the images to GitHub Packages. The access token ([generated here](https://github.com/settings/tokens))
should be stored in GitHub Repository Secrets as `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

## CD

The app is deployed automatically to prod from the master branch once tests pass. Production secrets are stored in
GitHub Repository Secrets. The production Docker containers run on a DigitalOcean droplet. The Docker images are
pulled from GitHub packages with the same access token that is used in CI.
